/* got in the shower, had a revelation that divs existed, and i didn't need to create a new paragraph and target it with ID, as its just plain bad practice, now appreciate divs more.
I used a border bottom, instead of using an HR, i found out <hr>s are just lines that are customizable so far... earlier in 2018
I have also found there are multiple ways of building this not, just this way, there are no correct ways just different methods. For now i will try and do things more per instructor.
