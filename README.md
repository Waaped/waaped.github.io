##gif_c200

Making this navi cursor work, took me to the desolate wasteland known as photobucket, and i have run into this issue.

This allegedly fixes the problem.

The gif~c200 file extension is occasionally used in some web services which work with or store animated GIFs, most notably Chrome web browser.

The gif~c200 file contains picture image in GIF format uploaded to site. It is created when you view a picture stored on these sites using a Google Chrome, or Chromium browsers - right click on picture and select Save picture as... option. The default option will be gif~c200 suffix.

It is likely that the gif~c200 file extension is derived from picture URL, for example:

http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/File:IhATr0i_zps1cdba049.gif~c200.gif

You can easily fix this by renaming .gif~c200 to gif which will restore the default file association for the files in all graphics editors.''
