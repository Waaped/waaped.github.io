## gif_c200

Making this navi cursor work, took me to the desolate wasteland known as photobucket, and i have run into this issue.

This allegedly fixes the problem.

The gif~c200 file extension is occasionally used in some web services which work with or store animated GIFs, most notably Chrome web browser.

The gif~c200 file contains picture image in GIF format uploaded to site. It is created when you view a picture stored on these sites using a Google Chrome, or Chromium browsers - right click on picture and select Save picture as... option. The default option will be gif~c200 suffix.

It is likely that the gif~c200 file extension is derived from picture URL, for example:

http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/File:IhATr0i_zps1cdba049.gif~c200.gif

You can easily fix this by renaming .gif~c200 to gif which will restore the default file association for the files in all graphics editors.''

## CSS Cursor Conclusion..

It wasn't until i used single quotes that navi.png finally made it appearance.
png is the safest bet, as svg, gif and other similar formats did not function in Chrome.

It might be a bit antiquated, but custom cursor could come in handy.

The next step would likely to build a animated Cursor using Javascript.

## em mystery conclusion sort of..

The em size unit is recommended by the W3C. 1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

globally set in this instance
